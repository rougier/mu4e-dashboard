*mu4e Dahsboard*

mu4e dahsboard provides a new =mu4e= org link type that allows to execute
various mu4e queries when clicked. Such links can be organised into a
dashboard, by simply writing an org file as shown below:

*Screenshot 1*: Full page dashboard

[[./dashboard.png]]

*Screenshot 2*: Side dashboard

[[./dashboard-2.png]]

** Installation

Evaluate the buffer and you're good to go. It is your responsibility to
write an org file with links pointing to varius queries on your mailboxes.

** Configuration

*** Links

The link syntax is quite intuitive:

#+begin_src org
[[mu4e:query|format|count][description]]
#+end_src

=query= must be a valid mu4e query and =count= (optional) is the maximum
number of results to be returned. When the link is clicked,
=mu4e-headers-search= is called with the proper query.

#+begin_src org
[[mu4e:flag:unread][All unread]]
[[mu4e:flag:unread||10][Last 10 unread]]
#+end_src

=format= can be used to specify that =query= results are to be counted in
order to update the descritption using the given format:

#+begin_src org
[[mu4e:flag:unread|%3d][---]]
#+end_src

With the example above, when the link is cliked, the =---= part will be
replaced by the number of unread mails.

*** Key bindings

Keybindings can be configured using the =KEYMAP= keyword in your org file:

#+begin_src org
#+KEYMAP: key | elisp function
#+end_src

For example, if you want to bind =;= to context switch, you would write:

#+begin_src org
#+KEYMAP: ; | mu4e-context-switch
#+end_src

*** Query test

In the provided [[dashboard.org]], there's a definition for a mu query that can be
called directly inside the org file using [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]]. This can be convenient if
you want to test a query before creating a link. Usage is quite simple:

#+begin_src org
#+CALL: query(flag:unread, 10)
#+RESULTS:
#+end_src

Just type *C-c C-c* on the call line and you should see query results under the
RESULTS line.


** Usage

   To activate the dashboard, type =mu4e-dashboard-acivate=. This will install
   a =mu4e-dashboard-mode= minor mode with dedicated keybindngs.
   
   To edit the org file, you'll need to deactivate if first using
   =mu4e-dashboard-deacivate=.
